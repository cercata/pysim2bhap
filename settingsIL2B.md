# Suggested settings for IL-2 Battle of Series planes

In IL2B we don't have the max speed and rpm in the telemetry, so we absolutlely need to put there the right values. Here I put the values for planes I have testes

## I-16 type 24

```
speedThreshold = 75
rpmThreshold = 95
maxSpeed = 620
maxRpm   = 2300
```


## Yak 1b Ser 127

```
speedThreshold = 75
rpmThreshold = 98
maxSpeed = 720
maxRpm   = 2700
```

## Tempest Mk6 Ser 2

```
speedThreshold = 75
rpmThreshold = 85
maxSpeed = 870
maxRpm   = 3700
```

## P-38J-25

```
speedThreshold = 75
rpmThreshold = 85
maxSpeed = 725
maxRpm   = 3000
```

## IL-2 1942

```
speedThreshold = 75
rpmThreshold = 95
maxSpeed = 570
maxRpm   = 2150
```

## Pe-2 Ser87

```
speedThreshold = 75
rpmThreshold = 95
maxSpeed = 790
maxRpm   = 2700
```

## BF-109 F4

```
speedThreshold = 75
rpmThreshold = 85
maxSpeed = 850
maxRpm   = 2700
```

## BF-109 G2

```
speedThreshold = 75
rpmThreshold = 88
maxSpeed = 850
maxRpm   = 2600
```

## BF-109 G4

```
speedThreshold = 75
rpmThreshold = 82
maxSpeed = 850
maxRpm   = 2800
```

## Fw-190 A-5

```
speedThreshold = 75
rpmThreshold = 85
maxSpeed = 850
maxRpm   = 2700
```

## Sopwith Camel

```
speedThreshold = 75
rpmThreshold = 95
maxSpeed = 240
maxRpm   = 1400
```
