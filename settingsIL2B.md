# Suggested settings for IL-2 Battle of Series planes

In IL2B we don't have the max speed and rpm in the telemetry, so we absolutlely need to put there the right values. Here I put the values for planes I have testes

## Yak 1b Ser 127

'''
speedThreshold = 75
rpmThreshold = 98
maxSpeed = 270
maxRpm   = 2700
'''


## BF-109 F4

'''
speedThreshold = 75
rpmThreshold = 85
maxSpeed = 850
maxRpm   = 2700
'''

## BF-109 G2

'''
speedThreshold = 75
rpmThreshold = 88
maxSpeed = 850
maxRpm   = 2600
